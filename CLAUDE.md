# Claude Code notes

The project rules are in `AGENTS.md`, imported above. Each nested `AGENTS.md` (`forge/`,
`forge/specs/azoth/`, `system/`, `.github/workflows/`) has a sibling `CLAUDE.md` that
imports it, so Claude Code loads the area rules when it reads files there. What follows
applies to Claude Code only.

- **Path-scoped rules.** `.claude/rules/<area>.md` loads when a file matching its `paths:`
  front matter is read; a rule without `paths:` loads in every session. A trap found while
  working becomes one line, with its reason, in the matching rule.
- **No `cd` prefix in shell commands.** The session starts at the repository root. After a
  `cd`, relative paths cannot be checked against the permission rules, so every such command
  asks for approval. Use paths relative to the root, `git -C <dir>`, `cargo -p <crate>`, or
  an absolute path.
- **Shared settings are permissions only.** `.claude/settings.json` denies secret paths and
  destructive commands; hooks and personal preferences stay in `.claude/settings.local.json`
  or `~/.claude/` (`.claude/README.md`).
